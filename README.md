# Code Review Challenge

The following challenge will be an opportunity to practice creating a pull-request (PR) and to review other people's code.

## Agenda

1. You will get time to solve the exercises
   - it does not matter how far you go!
   - what matters is to practice creating a new pull request (PR)
2. You will get time to create a pull request
3. You will review each other's pull requests :)
4. We will review a pull request together

## Run

You can run the files using `npm run <number of exercise>`:

```bash
npm run 1
npm run 2
...
npm run 8
```

You can add a `console.log()` to console the function, so you can see what is going wrong, and to check you result.

You can run the tests using:

```
npm test
```
